# etch-a-sketch
Introduction: By the end of this project we will have an interactive webpage that will work similarly to an etch-a-sketch. By using what I've learned about DOM manipulation, we can allow the user to draw an image by changing the colour of square divs arranged in a grid. This grid will be our canvas and the user can scale the grid to size by choosing how many square divs make up each side of the grid.

End of project summary: I had so much fun making this neat little program! It really helped me understand how Javascript is used to create dynamic webpages. By writing down my program on paper first I was able to create the logic of my program which really helped me when it came time to code. The most challenging aspect of this project was learning how to use event listeners to allow the user to draw, color, shade, and erase with a mouse and with touch in a way that makes the most sense. My biggest priority was usability and user experience, I wanted to make sure that the program was intuitive and compatible with mobile devices.
